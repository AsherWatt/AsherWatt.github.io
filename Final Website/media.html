            For the animation project I wanted to do more than just make movement, I wanted to make a short story. Since I had just finished the vector project I still had the idea of using fish in my head. I made a simple choice and showed the life of a worm ending in the mouth of a fish.

                Learning about adobe animate (or flash) was an interesting area but overall didn't seem that useful for the areas I want to improve. Either way, I had a ton of fun making this project.
