            My Print Based Media final was building a portfolio of my earlier projects, similar to this website. I Didn't really have a style in mind when I started building the design but as I moved forward I took cues from the idea of the light prism. I decided I wanted some sort of design that had highly saturated hues.

            InDesign is an amazing program, it's fun to work with and satisfying when you create something you can hold in your hands. Everyone should know the basics of InDesign.
