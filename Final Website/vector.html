            When I did the vector project I wanted something simple. At the time I recently dicussed puffer fish with another person and the idea was stuck in my head. The sushi chef was a quick addition for some humor.

            The first time I used Illustrator I hated it, I couldn't make any sense of it coming from Photoshop. I was entirely wrong, this program is amazing. I vastly prefer to work with Illustrator, as you can see, all of the banners for this site are made with Illustrator.
