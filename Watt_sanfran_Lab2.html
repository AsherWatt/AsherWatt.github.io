    San Francisco the best and worst.

    <h2>
    
    Noe Valley
    
    </h2>
    
    <p>
    
        Noe Valley offers a <em>quiet village feel</em> inside the bustling city of San Francisco. The neighborhood hides itself in between two hills creating a valley (hence the name) and creating a <strong>cozy intimate feeling </strong>. Noe Valley has also been where I have lived my entire life and has become a place where I know all the nooks and cranies and special places.

    <h2>
    
    Hunters Point
    
    </h2>
    
    <p>
    
        This neighboorhood has always been considered the <em>most dangerous area in San Francisco</em>. this area consistantly has high crime and gang issues. You can get in trouble walking into Hunters Point just for the color of your skin. In the shipyard area the soil is polluted causing cancer to long term residents. This neighboorhood is the <strong>shame of the city </strong>, an area the local government is incapable of improving.
